# BookStation23

**Objective:** To develop a Bookstore Management System that enables CRUD operations for books and authors and provides additional functionalities such as author selection, associated book view, and deletion of all associated books when an author is deleted.

**Description:** This system has been designed to help bookstore owners manage their inventory of books and associated authors. Users can add a new book and select an existing author from a dropdown or add a new author if they do not exist. Additionally, users can view the list of books associated with a particular author, and if an author is deleted, all their associated books will also be deleted. The system has been optimized for performance and efficiency, and adheres to best practices in software development.

**Future Update:** In the future, the plan is to add a cart and order table and implement buy and checkout functionalities to make it a complete ecommerce system.

**Technology Used:** This system has been developed using .Net 6 and C#, following the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern. The database has been implemented using EntityFramework Core, and SQL Server is used as the backend database. The system has been optimized for performance and efficiency.
